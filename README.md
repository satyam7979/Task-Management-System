# Task-Management-System

Task Management System. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Model: The model component will represent the data structure and business logic of the application. It will include classes such as Task, User, and TaskManager, which handle the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of tasks and user information.

View: The view component will handle the user interface, allowing users to interact with the system. It can include features such as task creation, task assignment, task status updates, and user authentication. The view will present information to the user and display the current state of tasks.

Controller: The controller component acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It will handle user actions, process requests from the view, and update the model accordingly. For example, when a user creates a new task, the controller will receive the request, validate the data, and update the model with the new task.

By following the MVC pattern, you can separate the concerns of data, user interface, and business logic. This makes the project more modular and maintainable. Additionally, you can incorporate other design patterns such as Observer for handling notifications or Factory for creating different types of tasks.

To enhance the project, you can consider adding additional features such as task prioritization, task filtering, task deadlines, user roles and permissions, and the ability to generate reports or notifications.

Remember to use appropriate frameworks like Spring MVC or JavaServer Faces (JSF) to facilitate the implementation of the MVC architecture in your Java project. These frameworks provide abstractions and tools that streamline the development process


Based on the information provided, here's a simplified ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram for the project:

sql
Copy code
+----------------+      +----------------+
|     User       |      |      Task      |
+----------------+      +----------------+
| id (PK)        |      | id (PK)        |
| username       |      | title          |
| password       |      | description    |
+----------------+      | createdAt      |
                        | assignedUserId |
                        +----------------+
In this ER diagram:

There are two main entities: User and Task.
The User entity has attributes such as id, username, and password.
The Task entity has attributes such as id, title, description, createdAt, and assignedUserId.
The assignedUserId attribute in the Task entity represents a foreign key referencing the id attribute of the User entity, indicating the user to whom the task is assigned.
This diagram represents a basic overview of the entities and their relationships in the Task Management System. Please note that it's a simplified representation and may not include all the attributes or relationships present in your specific project.

To create a more comprehensive and detailed ER diagram for your project, you may consider using visual modeling tools such as Lucidchart, draw.io, or other ER diagramming software. These tools allow you to create professional diagrams by adding tables, attributes, relationships, and cardinality indicators.
